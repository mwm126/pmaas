\begin{abstract}
%One of the main benefits of virtualization through cloud computing is the ready availability of large rapid virtual machines for rapid application deployment. As computing hardware advances, cloud computing vendors offer new virtual machines with new performance characteristics, adding to the large set of virtual machine types to choose from. Many virtual machine types are available, with varying performance and pricing options. In this work we present a statistical model for estimating the performance of new virtual machine types based on knowledge of existing types. This model is based on data collected by running the Yahoo! Cloud Services Benchmark (YCSB). The databases surveyed are the key-value database Redis, deployed on Amazon Elasticache, and the NoSQL databases Apache Cassandra, deployed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. We tested these on a variety of Amazon virtual machines types.

%A key difference between 
Cloud computing platforms such as Amazon EC2, Google Computing Engine, and Microsoft Azure
offer dozens of virtual machine (VM) types with a wide range of resource capacity vs. price trade-offs, requiring a customer to consider numerous resource configurations when evaluating service needs. This report investigates the possibility of using the diversity of VM types to predict the performance of new VM types using black box modeling. The performance model used is a multiple linear regression of the average server response time, server load (throughput in requests per second), the number of CPU cores, and the memory in the procured VM. For three commonly used database servers - Redis (key-value stores), Apache Cassandra (NoSQL) and MySQL -  the model accuracy increases for larger sets of VMs.  E.g., for Redis, the $R^2_{predicted}$ measure of model efficacy improves from 0.4-0.5 with 2 VM types for training and 0.7 for 3 VM types to 0.8 for 4 VM types.  These results suggest further interesting research challenges, such as the possibility of automating the process of calibrating performance models using diverse resource types on a public cloud leading to ``performance modeling as a service.''
