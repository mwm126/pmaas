\begin{itemize}
\item Performance modeling of s/w applications has a long history in a variety of domains. We only discuss some recent salient and representative efforts with close connections to our work.
\item Alternative modeling approaches: explicit modeling based on queuing theory, other Markovian models; black box modeling based on regression, time-series, prediction, learning, control theory; gray box such as Wisconsin, shivnath babu?. All of these modeling techniques are suitable candidates to benefit from our hypothesis as all of them require some form of offline/onling profiling whose quality might be improved via exploting diversity. 
\item Highly complementary to our work is a recent paper that exploits non-stationarity of transaction types. Their work can be readily combined with ours. 
\item Delta modeling from CMU has some similarities.
