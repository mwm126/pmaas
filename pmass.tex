\begin{abstract}
%One of the main benefits of virtualization through cloud computing is the ready availability of large rapid virtual machines for rapid application deployment. As computing hardware advances, cloud computing vendors offer new virtual machines with new performance characteristics, adding to the large set of virtual machine types to choose from. Many virtual machine types are available, with varying performance and pricing options. In this work we present a statistical model for estimating the performance of new virtual machine types based on knowledge of existing types. This model is based on data collected by running the Yahoo! Cloud Services Benchmark (YCSB). The databases surveyed are the key-value database Redis, deployed on Amazon Elasticache, and the NoSQL databases Apache Cassandra, deployed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. We tested these on a variety of Amazon virtual machines types.

A key difference between public cloud computing platforms and more conventional privately-owned data centers is the immense diversity of resource types offered by the former. For example, Amazon EC2, Google Computing Engine, and Microsoft Azure all offer dozens of virtual machine (VM) types offering different resource capacity vs. price points. A cost-conscious tenant procuring its IT needs from such a public cloud provider is faced with the prospect of having to calibrate its application performance models for an enormously large set of resource configurations. This might pose significant challenges both for the  scalability and cost of performance modeling needed for cost-effective resource procurement. We argue that, instead of it being a hindrance, it might be possible for a tenant to actually exploit the diversity of cloud resources to ease performance modeling. To illustrate this, we adapt a popular performance modeling technique based on multi-linear regression. Our model expresses the average response time of a class of interactive server applications as a linear combination of the offered throughput (requests/s), the number of CPU cores and memory in the procured VM, and degree of replication employed by the application. Using 3 different real-world applications (2 noSQL key-value stores - Redis and Apache Cassandra, and the MySQL database), we show that training our model using a more diverse set of VMs helps improve its accuracy. ** Furthermore, ... Some sample results. ** Although we consider a specific modeling approach, our basic observation is likely to benefit other modeling techniques developed in the literature. Our work opens up a number of interesting research challenges, including the possibility of (semi-) automating the process of calibrating performance models using diverse resource types on a public cloud leading to ``performance modeling as a service.''
