\subsection{MySQL}
\vspace{10pt}

\mm{
MySQL was deployed using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which abstracts away the deployment and administration of OS and relationship database software.

MySQL was deployed to six VM types as listed in Table \ref{table:rdstypes}.

We tested using YCSB Workload A (50\% read, 50\% write) with a uniform distribution.

We did a multiple linear regression on the variables throughput, cores, memory, and network.  (Network performance was quantified by representing it as an dummy variable.)

We used VM type r3.2xlarge as test data, while increasing the training data in Table \ref{table:mysql}.

However, the data for MySQL did not fit a multilinear regression well.  This may be due to the higher write latency of SQL databases, or something with Amazon's RDS architecture that made our YCSB testing method unsuitable.  Another possibility is that the network availability varied over time with RDS, making data collection unrepeatable.
